<p>Tutors not only help students with their current classes but they also teach the skills needed to succeed in any academic environment. Students who work with tutors develop stronger time management and study skills which are lifelong 
learning skills. Students in tutoring also gain knowledge of their learning styles and strengths leading to becoming better advocates for themselves in the classroom.

The right tutor will have a positive affect on your student's academic performance, self-confidence, and self-esteem.

Students learn best when their individual academic needs are met. One-on-one instruction has been proven to increase understanding of material. Teachers often work tirelessly to provide the best possible education for students

but unfortunately the modern school system makes individualized instruction impossible. The class sizes are too large and only a skilled teacher can teach to students with varied learning styles. The current education environment places
a greater emphasis on standardizing testing while neglecting other skills necessary for academic success.  

Tutors also provide a safe environment for students. Often when a student is struggling in class, they are relunctant to particpate in class. They are afraid of getting the wrong answer and looking bad in front of their peers. Often students with 
disabilites feel left behind in school. The curriculum goes too fast and teachers are often not flexible. Tutors can break down the material into smaller sections so the students are not overwhelmed. 

Tutoring also help reduce learning over winter holidays or summer breaks. The also help students start the school year ahead of other students. </p>
